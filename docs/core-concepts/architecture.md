# Architecture

You know how these things work.

## Core Components

```
ψ → φ → q
     ↓
   [core]
     ↓
λ ← η ← ε
```

## State Management

Obviously:

```typescript
const η = φ * ψ / q;
```

## Entropy Flow

```
[input] → ψ → [quantum field] → φ → [output]
              ↑
           [chaos]
```

## Integration Points

Standard connection pattern:

```typescript
j.connect({
  ψ: Math.E,
  φ: (1 + Math.sqrt(5)) / 2,
  // You know what this does
  η: true
});
```

## Scaling

```
n+1 nodes → ψ-replication → φ-distribution
```

You get the idea.
