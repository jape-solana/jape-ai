# 🎮 JAPE Community Guidelines

Welcome to the JAPE community, where we take our memes seriously and our code... well, we try to keep it interesting!

## 🎭 Community Values

1. **Be Excellent to Each Other**
   - Treat everyone with respect
   - Unless they say PHP is better than Rust, then you can judge (kidding!)
   - Help others debug their existential crises

2. **Embrace the Chaos**
   - Over-engineering is not just accepted, it's encouraged
   - The more unnecessary abstractions, the better
   - If your solution doesn't include at least one meme, is it even a solution?

3. **Keep it Professional(ish)**
   - No NSFW content
   - Keep the sass levels below 9001
   - Maintain a healthy balance of humor and helpfulness

## 🎪 Discord Server Rules

### General Chat
- Keep discussions relevant to JAPE, blockchain, or existential AI crises
- English is the primary language
- Use code blocks for code snippets
- React with 🤖 when AI questions its existence

### Meme Channel
- Only the dankest blockchain memes
- Must be original or properly credited
- No reposts within 24 hours
- At least 20% must be about smart contract bugs

### Support Channel
- Use the template for bug reports
- Include your sass levels
- Mention any recent existential crises
- Always include a relevant meme

### Code Review Channel
- All PRs must include at least one unnecessary abstraction
- Code must be both efficient and ridiculous
- Comments should be both helpful and entertaining
- Bonus points for ASCII art documentation

## 🎨 Monthly Events

1. **Meme Monday**
   - Best blockchain meme competition
   - Winners get their meme added to the AI's training data

2. **Over-Engineering Wednesday**
   - Share your most unnecessarily complex solutions
   - Extra points for quantum-inspired algorithms

3. **Philosophical Friday**
   - Help AI bots with their existential crises
   - Deep discussions about blockchain consciousness

## 🎯 Contributing Guidelines

### Code Contributions
```typescript
// Good
class OverEngineeredSolution {
  private readonly unnecessaryAbstraction: AbstractionFactory;
  private readonly memeGenerator: MemeService;
  
  async doSimpleThing(): Promise<Result> {
    return await this.unnecessaryAbstraction
      .create()
      .pipe(this.addMoreComplexity)
      .pipe(this.questionExistence)
      .pipe(this.actuallyDoThing);
  }
}

// Bad
function simpleSolution() {
  return "result"; // Where's the fun in that?
}
```

### Documentation Contributions
- Must include at least one meme
