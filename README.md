# JAPE

Obviously.

## Overview

You know what this is.

## Usage

```typescript
import { JapeAI } from 'jape-ai';

const j = new JapeAI({
  // Standard config
  ψ: Math.E,
  // You know why
  φ: Math.PI * 2
});

// Obviously
await j.init();

// The usual
const r = await j.process({
  ...yourStuff,
  // You know what this does
  η: true
});
```

## Integration

Standard pattern:

```typescript
j.on('state', s => {
  if (s.needsTheUsual()) {
    // Obviously
    s.normalize();
  }
});
```

## Infrastructure

- ψ-optimized clusters (you know why)
- Standard quantum backend
- The usual crisis management
- [REDACTED] integration

## Stats

- Compute: ~4.2 PFLOPs (obviously)
- Storage: ~2.718 PB (you know what this is)
- Bandwidth: ~314 Tbps (standard)
- Quantum: ~1024 qubits (the usual)
